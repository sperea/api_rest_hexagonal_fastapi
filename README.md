## API FastAPI framework + Hexagonal Architecture

[ work in progress ]

I am currently developing a structure for an API in Python 3.11 using FastAPI and following the Hexagonal Architecture principles.

The Hexagonal Architecture is a software design pattern that promotes the separation of concerns between different components of an application. It aims to improve the flexibility and maintainability of the code by decoupling the core business logic from external dependencies such as databases, APIs, or user interfaces.

In this project, I am using FastAPI as the web framework to build the API. FastAPI is a modern, fast, and efficient framework that allows me to define the API endpoints and request/response models using the Pydantic library.

I am also using the Injector library to implement dependency injection in the application, which allows me to decouple the core business logic from external dependencies such as database access or external APIs.

I hope you find this project useful and if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!
